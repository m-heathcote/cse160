    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <p>
      It's basically knock-off minecraft.

      <br><br>
      (5/13/24) I made a couple aesthetic changes that will show up in the live hosted version after<br>
      the due date because it was gonna bother me if I didn't make the changes, but functionally my<br>
      program is the same, and you can check my code on canvas for the time-stamped version<br>
      turned in before the due date (I don't want to use a late day for my changes).
